## About The Project

ðŸ“ŒLexical analysis :

Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these syntax's into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.

*Tokenization: Start by creating a lexer that will take the source code and break it into tokens.
*Regular Expressions: We will use regular expressions to match the tokens.
*Symbol Table: We will use a symbol table to store the tokens.

ðŸ“ŒSyntax analysis :

Syntax analysis is the second phase of a compiler. It takes the token produced by lexical analysis as input and generates a parse tree (or syntax tree). Syntax analysis checks the tokens for any syntax errors. It also adds the additional information to the parse tree.

*Grammar: We will use a grammar to define the syntax of our language.
*Parser: We will use a parser to parse the tokens.
*Abstract Syntax Tree: We will use an abstract syntax tree to store the tokens.
*Error Handling: We will use error handling to handle any syntax errors.
