## About The Project

ðŸ“ŒLexical analysis : 

is the process of converting a sequence of characters in a source code file into a sequence of tokens that can be more easily processed by a compiler or interpreter. It is often the first phase of the compilation process and is followed by syntax analysis and semantic analysis.

ðŸ“ŒSyntax analysis :

also known as parsing, is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language or in a computer language, according to the rules of formal grammar. It involves checking whether a given input is correctly structured according to the syntax of the language.
